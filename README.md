***
#### Web App Description
The online shopping subsystem that the group has built is intended for the administrators use. The administrators have the ability to modify all items and users, create discount codes and sales items, view the history of orders, and create/Modify Items for sale. With the sales of items as the main focus of the app we can see in the app the full description of the item in detail. We can also choose to add and change details of the item such as Name, Status, Stock, Item Type, Price, and Image. Along with that we can also change the information of users. This includes Username, Password, Name, and status.
